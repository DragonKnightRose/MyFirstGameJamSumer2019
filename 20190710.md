# An Inauspicious Start

## Random Generators

>The story is about a cowardly woman who must find a magic ring, find a magic mirror, and defeat a giant to save a prince.  Things are complicated by the villain kidnapping the main character's brother.  Assistance comes in the form of a magic horse.

It's a start. Who knows, maybe this will be the first time I finish a game? This little blurb, spit out by a webpage, could be the start of something great.

Or not. But it's a start!

## The Village

We start off in a pretty run-down place. Poor town has had a string of bad luck: civil war, natural disasters, etc. Just when things seemed like they might be looking up, and like the kingdom might actually invest in helping them to rebuild, the visiting prince gets kidnapped!

## Progress Thus Far

Right now we've got a player character, a test map for playing around with mechanics, our starting village, and something vaguely resembling a plot. Oh, and a niffty little spider-monster who can spit webs and kill us. So cute.
